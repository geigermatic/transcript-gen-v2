# PRD: Show, Don't Tell - Direct Editing with AI Pattern Recognition

## Overview

Enable users to demonstrate desired changes by editing text directly, with AI intelligently recognizing patterns and offering to apply similar changes throughout the document. This creates a revolutionary "show, don't tell" editing experience that combines manual precision with AI scale.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **Communication Gap**: Users struggle to articulate abstract editing concepts ("make it warmer", "less formal")
- **Iteration Cycles**: Describe → AI interprets → Review → Repeat until satisfied
- **Ambiguity**: AI often misunderstands user intent from text descriptions
- **Limited Control**: Users can't show exactly what they want, only describe it

### Market Opportunity
- **Unique Positioning**: No existing AI writing tool offers this capability
- **Competitive Moat**: Technical complexity creates defensible advantage
- **User Delight**: Intuitive workflow that feels magical when it works

## Solution

### Example-Driven AI Editing
Allow users to edit text directly in a rich editor while AI observes changes, recognizes patterns, and offers to apply similar modifications throughout the document.

### Core Workflow
1. **User edits directly**: Changes "you should meditate" → "you might consider meditation"
2. **AI recognizes pattern**: "Softening tone, making less prescriptive"
3. **AI offers assistance**: "Apply this gentler tone to the rest of the document?"
4. **User maintains control**: Accept, reject, or modify AI suggestions

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Editing Speed**: 3x faster workflows compared to chat-only editing
- **Revision Reduction**: 85% fewer back-and-forth cycles
- **User Satisfaction**: 90%+ prefer direct editing in user testing
- **Feature Adoption**: 70% of users try direct editing within first session

### Secondary KPIs
- **Pattern Recognition Accuracy**: 80%+ correct intent detection
- **Suggestion Acceptance Rate**: 60%+ of AI suggestions accepted
- **Time to Value**: Users see AI suggestions within 30 seconds of editing
- **Retention Impact**: 25% increase in weekly active users

## User Stories

### Core User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want to edit text directly so I can show exactly what I want
2. **As a user**, I want AI to understand my changes so I don't have to explain them
3. **As a user**, I want AI to offer to apply my changes consistently throughout the document
4. **As a user**, I want to accept or reject AI suggestions with one click

### Advanced User Stories
1. **As a power user**, I want to see confidence scores for AI pattern recognition
2. **As a user**, I want to preview AI suggestions before applying them
3. **As a user**, I want AI to learn my editing patterns over time
4. **As a user**, I want to apply patterns selectively to specific sections

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Overview
```typescript
interface DirectEditingSystem {
  // Rich text editor with change tracking
  editor: RichTextEditor;
  
  // Real-time change detection
  changeDetector: ChangeDetector;
  
  // AI pattern recognition
  patternAnalyzer: PatternAnalyzer;
  
  // Suggestion system
  suggestionEngine: SuggestionEngine;
  
  // State management
  editingState: EditingState;
}

interface EditingState {
  // Current document content
  content: string;
  
  // Active editing session
  activeEdits: EditAction[];
  
  // AI analysis results
  detectedPatterns: Pattern[];
  
  // Pending suggestions
  suggestions: Suggestion[];
  
  // Undo/redo integration
  undoStack: EditAction[];
}
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Rich Text Editor
- **Real-time change tracking**: Detect what, where, and when changes occur
- **Diff calculation**: Efficient algorithms for before/after comparison
- **Selection handling**: Track cursor position and text selections
- **Formatting preservation**: Maintain markdown, bullets, headers

#### 2. Change Detection Pipeline
```typescript
interface ChangeDetector {
  // Detect changes in real-time
  detectChanges(before: string, after: string): Change[];
  
  // Debounced analysis trigger
  triggerAnalysis(changes: Change[]): void;
  
  // Change classification
  classifyChange(change: Change): ChangeType;
}

enum ChangeType {
  TONE_ADJUSTMENT = 'tone_adjustment',
  FORMATTING_CHANGE = 'formatting_change',
  CONTENT_ADDITION = 'content_addition',
  CONTENT_REMOVAL = 'content_removal',
  STRUCTURAL_CHANGE = 'structural_change'
}
```

#### 3. AI Pattern Recognition
```typescript
interface PatternAnalyzer {
  // Analyze user changes for patterns
  analyzePattern(changes: Change[]): Promise<Pattern>;
  
  // Generate suggestions based on patterns
  generateSuggestions(pattern: Pattern, document: string): Suggestion[];
  
  // Confidence scoring
  calculateConfidence(pattern: Pattern): number;
}

interface Pattern {
  type: ChangeType;
  description: string;
  confidence: number;
  examples: string[];
  applicableLocations: Location[];
}
```

### Integration Points

#### With Single View Editing
- **Unified undo stack**: Direct edits and AI suggestions in same history
- **State synchronization**: Keep editor and undo system in sync
- **Conflict resolution**: Handle simultaneous manual and AI changes

#### With Existing Chat System
- **Dual input modes**: Users can edit directly OR use chat
- **Consistent results**: Same underlying AI for both approaches
- **Seamless switching**: Move between direct editing and chat naturally

- [ ] Create simple pattern recognition (tone, formatting)
- [ ] Add basic suggestion UI ("Apply similar changes?")

### Phase 2: Intelligence (3 weeks)
- [ ] Advanced pattern recognition with confidence scoring
- [ ] Smart suggestion generation and preview
