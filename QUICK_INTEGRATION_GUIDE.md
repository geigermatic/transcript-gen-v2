// Add import at the top
import { UnifiedChatInterface } from './UnifiedChatInterface';

// Replace the existing chat area (around line 600-700) with:
<div className="flex-1 flex flex-col min-h-0">
  <UnifiedChatInterface 
    selectedDocument={selectedDocument}
    className="h-full"
  />
</div>
```

   - "Rephrase this in a warmer tone"
   - "Summarize the key takeaways"
   - "Add practical examples to this content"

## **Step 3: Validate Caren's Voice (10 minutes)**

## **üí° Pro Tips**

### **For Best Results**
1. **Use natural language**: Speak to the chat as you would to a human assistant
2. **Be specific**: "Reformat the introduction as bullet points" vs "reformat this"
3. **Leverage Caren's voice**: Ask for "warmer," "more compassionate," or "teaching-focused" tone
4. **Use quick actions**: They're optimized for common tasks

### **Command Examples That Work Well**
```
"Make this introduction warmer and more welcoming"
"Reformat the key takeaways as numbered steps"
"Add practical examples to help beginners understand"
"Simplify this explanation for someone new to meditation"
"Rephrase this with more of Caren's compassionate voice"
```
