# Future Enhancements

## Summarization Quality Controls

### User-Configurable Chunk Sizing
Allow users to choose between processing speed and summary detail level.

**Implementation:**
- Add setting to SettingsPanel for "Summarization Quality"
- Three preset modes:
  - **üöÄ Fast Mode**: 500-800 words/chunk (~8-15 chunks)
    - Processing time: 30-60 seconds
    - Quality: Good, concise summaries
  - **‚öñÔ∏è Balanced Mode**: 200-400 words/chunk (~20-40 chunks) 
    - Processing time: 2-4 minutes
    - Quality: Great detail with reasonable speed
  - **üî¨ Detailed Mode**: 50-100 words/chunk (~80-150 chunks)
    - Processing time: 8-15 minutes  
    - Quality: Maximum granularity and detail

**Technical Requirements:**
- Update TextSplitter configuration to accept chunk size parameter
- Pass setting from store to SummarizationEngine
- Show estimated processing time based on document size
- Add progress indicator with time remaining
- Allow cancellation of long-running summarizations

**UX Considerations:**
- Default to "Balanced" mode for new users
- Remember user preference across sessions
- Show warning for "Detailed" mode on large documents
- Consider smart defaults based on document size

**Advanced Features (Future):**
- Adaptive chunk sizing based on document type (transcripts vs articles)
- Progressive summarization (quick overview first, then detailed on demand)
- Preview mode with option to continue for more detail
- Smart chunking that respects natural breaks in transcripts

**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days
**Dependencies:** Settings system, UI components
