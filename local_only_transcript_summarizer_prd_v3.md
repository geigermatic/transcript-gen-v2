# Local-Only Transcript Summarizer ‚Äî PRD v3

## Overview
A **local, browser-based application** (no Electron) that summarizes teaching transcripts and supports ChatGPT‚Äëlike conversational Q&A using a local Ollama instance. All data and learning stay on the user's machine, ensuring privacy and IP protection.

The target user is a non-technical meditation and techniques teacher who needs to generate summaries, course materials, and descriptions in her own voice for use on her website and in course development.

**Current Status:** MVP complete with integrated dashboard interface, style guide management, and real-time Ollama status monitoring.

---

## Goals
- Ingest `.docx` and other supported transcript/document formats into a **local library**.
- Generate accurate summaries of long (30‚Äì60 min) recordings or documents, including specific **techniques used**.
- Provide **multi-turn conversational Q&A** grounded in transcripts.
- Enable **voice/style customization** so outputs match the user‚Äôs preferred tone and structure.
- Allow **A/B summary comparisons** with winner selection and reasoning.
- Learn from user feedback to bias future summaries/answers.
- Maintain **beautiful, world-class glassmorphic UI** for non-technical users.
- Provide full developer observability in early builds with detailed logs and status tracking.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Local LLM:** Ollama chat API (`llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M`, configurable)
- **Local Embeddings:** Ollama (`nomic-embed-text`)
- **Storage (MVP):** browser localStorage (upgrade to SQLite/OPFS for durability in Phase 2)

---

## Security / Privacy
- Runs on `localhost` only.
- Only communicates with `http://127.0.0.1:11434` (Ollama).
- No telemetry or external calls.
- All data persists locally.
