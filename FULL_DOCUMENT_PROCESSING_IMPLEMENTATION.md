# Full Document Processing Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
Restore comprehensive document processing capabilities while maintaining performance improvements, addressing all four core requirements:
1. Building a library of documents for LLM access
2. Processing entire transcripts for comprehensive fact extraction
3. Chat capability for summary revision and generation
4. Proper voice style application via detailed prompts

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: Restore Full Document Processing (Core Functionality) âœ… COMPLETE

### Task 1.1: Replace Sampling with Full Document Processing âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Remove `sampleDocumentIntelligently` method
- [x] Remove `buildSmartSummaryPrompt` method  
- [x] Restore full document processing in `generateCombinedSummary`
- [x] Ensure entire document text is processed, not sampled
- [x] Maintain the improved error handling and progress tracking

### Task 1.2: Restore Comprehensive Fact Extraction âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Re-implement `extractFactsFromChunk` for full LLM processing
- [x] Ensure each chunk is processed completely by the LLM
- [x] Maintain the optimized chunking strategies (but for full content)
- [x] Restore fact merging and consolidation logic
- [x] Test fact extraction quality and completeness

### Task 1.3: Restore Full LLM Integration âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Re-implement `generateRawSummary` with full LLM processing
- [x] Restore `generateStyledSummary` with complete voice application
- [x] Ensure style guides are applied to entire summaries
- [x] Test LLM processing quality and voice consistency
- [x] Verify processing time improvements vs. original 30-second delays
