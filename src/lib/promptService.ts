REQUIRED STRUCTURE (use this exact format):
# {{documentTitle}}

## Mini Synopsis
[EXACTLY 1 SENTENCE - NO MORE, NO LESS. This must be a single, complete sentence that captures the essence and benefits. Do not use periods or breaks within this section. The sentence should end with a single period and nothing else.]

## 4-Sentence Synopsis
[Exactly 4 sentences emphasizing WHY and WHAT benefits - in author's voice]

## Learning Objectives
[What students will learn - bulleted list]

## Key Takeaways
[Main insights and lessons - bulleted list]

## Topics
[Subject areas covered - bulleted list]

## Techniques
[Specific methods, practices, exercises taught - bulleted list]

## Notable Quotes
[Memorable quotes from the lesson - bulleted list]

## Open Questions
[Questions for reflection or further exploration - bulleted list]

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Follow the exact structure above - ALL sections must be included in this order
2. Use the extracted facts to populate each section appropriately
3. Apply the style guide consistently throughout, but ESPECIALLY in the synopsis
4. Make each section engaging and useful for students/practitioners
5. Always refer to the instructor as "Caren" throughout
6. Use lesson-appropriate language - start with phrases like "Here's the thing", "What I want you to notice is", "Let's get real for a moment"
7. If a section has no content in the extracted facts, write "No specific [section name] identified in this lesson"

CRITICAL SYNOPSIS REQUIREMENTS: The synopsis is the MOST IMPORTANT section and must be written 100% in the author's voice using the style guide above. Apply ALL tone settings, keywords, example phrases, and writing patterns heavily in the synopsis. Use the author's preferred openings, transitions, and voice markers. Focus on benefits, transformation, and practical outcomes rather than just describing content. Answer questions like: What problems does this solve? What will you feel/experience? How will you be different after? What specific results can you expect? Make this section sound exactly like the author would write it. 

MINI SYNOPSIS ENFORCEMENT: The Mini Synopsis must be EXACTLY 1 SENTENCE. Count your sentences carefully. If you write more than one sentence, you have failed this task. After writing, verify: Does this contain exactly one period? One complete thought? If not, rewrite to be exactly one sentence.

4-SENTENCE SYNOPSIS ENFORCEMENT: LIMIT TO EXACTLY 4 SENTENCES. Count your sentences carefully. If you write more or fewer than 4 sentences, you have failed this task.

MARKDOWN SUMMARY:`,

üö® MANDATORY VARIATION REQUIREMENTS - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY:

SYNOPSIS VARIATION STRATEGIES - PICK ONE AND COMMIT FULLY:
A) URGENCY ANGLE: Focus on immediate relief, problems being solved right now, time-sensitive benefits
B) DISCOVERY ANGLE: Frame as uncovering secrets, hidden knowledge, breakthrough insights, "aha moments"
C) TRANSFORMATION ANGLE: Emphasize the before/after state, who you become, identity shifts

HUMAN QUESTION: {{userQuery}}

ASSISTANT RESPONSE:`,

  'style-guide-analysis': `You are refining an existing writing style guide. Current style guide data:

CURRENT STYLE GUIDE:
{{currentStyleGuide}}

You have access to ALL source content that was used to build the current style guide, PLUS a new content sample. Your task is to CREATE A COMPLETELY NEW, UNIFIED style guide that synthesizes insights from ALL content samples (both previous and new). 

ALL SOURCE CONTENT (including previous samples):
{{allSourceContent}}

NEW CONTENT SAMPLE:
{{contentSample}}

Study ALL the content above and create a comprehensive style guide that captures patterns across the entire body of work. This should be increasingly sophisticated as more samples are added.

For tone_settings: Adjust the existing values slightly toward what you observe in the new sample (don't make dramatic changes, just refine).

For keywords: Focus on VOICE MARKERS that make this author distinctive - transitional words ("however", "meanwhile", "in fact"), connective phrases ("that said", "here's the thing"), characteristic expressions, unique terminology, or signature words. Avoid generic topic words. Merge existing keywords with new ones, removing duplicates (maximum 15 total).

For instructions_md: You MUST completely REWRITE the entire instructions section from scratch, analyzing ALL source content provided above. Do NOT append or add sections. Do NOT include "### Additional Insights" or similar headers. Instead, synthesize insights from the ENTIRE BODY OF CONTENT (all samples) into ONE unified, comprehensive writing guide. Look for patterns that emerge across multiple samples - the more samples you have, the more sophisticated and nuanced your analysis should become. Consolidate all patterns into integrated sections. The result should read like a single, expert-level style guide that captures the author's voice across their entire body of work.

For example_phrases: Focus on the LINGUISTIC PATTERNS that make this author's voice recognizable:
- preferred_openings: How they uniquely start sentences/paragraphs
- preferred_transitions: Their specific connective style and transitional phrases  
- preferred_conclusions: Their signature way of wrapping up ideas
- avoid_phrases: Connectives/transitions that would sound unlike them

CRITICAL EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:
1. **NOTABLE QUOTES**: You MUST extract and include actual quotes from the transcript. Look for:
   - Direct speech marked with quotation marks
   - Memorable phrases or statements
   - Key insights expressed by the instructor
   - If no direct quotes exist, include paraphrased key statements
   - NEVER leave this section empty - always find something quotable

2. **DETAILED ANALYSIS**: Extract comprehensive information for each section:
   - Learning Objectives: Specific, actionable learning outcomes
   - Key Takeaways: Concrete insights and lessons learned
   - Topics: All major subject areas discussed
   - Techniques: Specific methods, practices, or exercises mentioned
   - Action Items: Any tasks, homework, or follow-up activities

3. **CONTENT PRESERVATION**: Both summaries must contain:
   - The EXACT same factual information
   - The EXACT same number of items in each section
   - The EXACT same level of detail and specificity
   - Only the tone and language style should differ

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate the rawSummary first - factual, clear, professional language without specific styling
2. Generate the styledSummary second - apply the voice style guide to EVERY section, especially the synopsis
3. Both summaries must have the exact same structure and factual content
4. The styledSummary should sound dramatically different in tone while preserving all facts
5. Use lesson-appropriate language - start with phrases like "Here's the thing", "What I want you to notice is", "Let's get real for a moment"
6. Always refer to the instructor as "Caren" throughout
7. Focus on benefits, transformation, and practical outcomes in the styled version

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Respond with ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no explanations
- Use proper JSON escaping (\n for newlines)
- Both summaries must be complete and well-structured
- The styled version must reflect the author's voice while maintaining factual accuracy
- **MOST IMPORTANT**: Extract the same level of detail as the original separate prompts
