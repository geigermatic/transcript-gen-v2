# PRD: 1K Document Architecture - Local Vector Database System

## Overview

Transform the current linear search system into a scalable vector database architecture capable of handling 1,000+ documents with sub-second search performance. This system will provide 20-50x performance improvements even for smaller document libraries while future-proofing for massive scale.

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have Today (Strengths to Preserve)
- **✅ Complete Local Privacy**: All documents and embeddings stay on user's device
- **✅ Offline-First Architecture**: Works without internet connection
- **✅ Advanced Embedding Pipeline**: Full semantic search with Ollama integration
- **✅ Context-Aware Chat**: Enhanced chat engine with capability routing
- **✅ Document Management**: Robust IndexedDB storage with metadata
- **✅ Summary Generation**: A/B testing and version management
- **✅ Hybrid Search**: Semantic + keyword search combination

### Current Performance Bottlenecks (What We're Fixing)
- **❌ Linear Search Algorithm**: O(n) complexity in `EmbeddingEngine.searchSimilar()`
- **❌ In-Memory Embedding Arrays**: All embeddings loaded into RAM during search
- **❌ No Persistent Vector Index**: Similarity calculations repeated every search
- **❌ Docker Performance**: 60+ second processing times vs. 30 seconds native
- **❌ Memory Inefficiency**: 50-100MB peak usage for embedding operations

### Privacy-First Value Proposition (Non-Negotiable)
- **🔒 Zero Cloud Dependencies**: No embeddings or documents sent to external services
- **🔒 Local-Only Processing**: All AI operations happen on user's machine
- **🔒 Offline Capability**: Full functionality without internet connection
- **🔒 User Data Sovereignty**: Users own and control their data completely
- **🔒 No Vendor Lock-in**: Data portable and accessible without our service
