# Chat-Centric Elira Interface Redesign - PRD & Implementation Plan

## Product Requirements Document (PRD): Chat-Centric Elira Interface

### Executive Summary
Transform Elira from a traditional card-based dashboard to a modern, chat-centric AI interface similar to Claude. This will create a more intuitive user experience where document processing, summarization, and Q&A happen in a natural conversation flow.

### Current State Analysis
- **Dashboard Layout**: Separate cards for upload, summary, chat, and recent docs
- **User Flow**: Upload → Process → View Summary → Chat separately
- **Issues**: Fragmented experience, wasted space, complex navigation
- **User Expectation**: Modern AI apps should feel conversational

### Target State Vision
- **Primary Interface**: Single chat conversation where everything happens
- **Workflow**: Upload → Process → Chat → Reference, all in one thread
- **Layout**: Chat interface (left 2/3) + Document sidebar (right 1/3)
- **Experience**: Feels like talking to a knowledgeable AI assistant

### User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want to upload documents through natural conversation
2. **As a user**, I want to see summaries appear in our chat conversation
3. **As a user**, I want to ask questions about any document in the same chat
4. **As a user**, I want to easily switch between documents via sidebar
5. **As a user**, I want the interface to feel like modern AI apps I'm familiar with

### Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Increased time spent in app
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Fewer clicks to complete tasks
- **User Satisfaction**: More intuitive, less confusing interface
- **Mobile Experience**: Better usability on smaller screens
